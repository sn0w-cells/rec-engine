# Project Name
This project is called Recommendation Engine. This is a content-based recommendation engine that provides personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and interests. The recommendation engine uses the content of the items being recommended, such as their descriptions or features, to determine which items are most relevant to a particular user.

## Description
A content-based filtering recommendation system is a type of recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences and interests. This type of system uses the content of the items being recommended, such as their descriptions, features, or attributes, to determine which items are most relevant to a particular user.

Content-based filtering works by building a user profile based on their previous interactions or explicit feedback, and then using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract features from the textual content of the items. These features are then used to train a machine learning algorithm, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) or support vector machines (SVM), which generates personalized recommendations for each user.

The key advantage of content-based filtering is that it can make recommendations for new items that have no previous interactions or feedback. This approach also has some limitations, such as the inability to capture user preferences that are not reflected in the content, and the potential for over-recommending items that are very similar to previous choices.

Overall, content-based filtering is a useful approach for recommendation systems when there is a large amount of content data available and when the focus is on providing personalized recommendations based on the user's interests and preferences.
